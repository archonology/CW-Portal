## Description
For Child Welfare workers in Minnesota, there is a lack of centralized resources that are up to date and pertain to the essential duties, tools, history, and background of all things child welfare. Training and access to resources is scattered and far, far from comprehensive. child welfare workers need a comprehensive hub for all the best and most essential resources. That hub needs to be dynamic and easy to update, add, and remove resources from because of the constant changes in the child welfare field. There are many resource sites for CW workers available, but most of them have static data that is difficult to update, thus most of them are full of expired links and out of date info.

Enter the Child Welfare Portal. This application addresses the need for dynamic and easy to update data. It is simple to use and organized in three categories of data: Topics, Subtopics, and Resources. Resources can belong to both Topics and Subtopics, and Subtopics belong to Topics. 

This application was created by former child welfare workers, and we went to great pains to be sure that we can keep it up to date and that the info within it is highly relevant to CW workers (the screenshot was taken during dev phase, hence it doesn't showcase the real resources the deployed site has/will have). 

With the Child Welfare Portal, users can store their favorite resources in their dashboard, as well as keep a simple kanban of "to-do", "doing", and "done", as they go through learning or revisiting resource links. 

The site also has a donate link(https://buy.stripe.com/cN26ox1O4eMkf7ifYY) -- please help if you can! We want to grow this site to be something essential for child welfare workers, and we have many ideas about how to develop it even further!
